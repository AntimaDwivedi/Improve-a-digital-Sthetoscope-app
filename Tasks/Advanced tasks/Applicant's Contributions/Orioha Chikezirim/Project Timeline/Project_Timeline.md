# Project Timeline

I Joined Mboalab an open and collaborative space located in Yaoundé, Cameroon, whose aim is to catalyse sustainable local development and improve people’s living conditions through open science, to work on one of the projects, which is, Improve a Digital Stethoscope Android App. To Achieve this project, we have to work on an already existing Android Application, which serves as a digital stethoscope, that can make use of Machine Learning for sounds classification on open data and could also display the pulse rate. The aim of building the application is also to make acquisition of a digital stethoscope affordable in low-income countries and prevent crosscontamination due to touch. I am working together with two mentors, Jafsia Elisee and Stephane Fadanka to achieve this goal.
Before the first internship week
