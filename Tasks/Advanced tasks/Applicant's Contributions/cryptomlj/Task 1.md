### MBOALAB (Improve Digital Stethoscope app)


### ABOUT THE TASK
This task requires the applicant to propose a logo design for the Digital Setethoscope android app. In short, the logo should communicate the projectâ€™s core objectives and importance in an interesting way

The aim of the project is to create an affordable digital stethoscope which can be accessed and used in any part of the world.

This stethoscope will be made to work with an Android application which collects the sound generated from the chest-piece of a stethoscope and transferred via the tubing, this data will be transformed into its digital form via a microphone which is connected to an android phone that serves as a headset part of a stethoscope, where the sounds generated can be used for analysis of the internal organ performance and can also be recorded for further analysis by the doctor.

With the information gathered about the project, I made logos that I propose be used for the project. The logos were made using Adobe Express.
