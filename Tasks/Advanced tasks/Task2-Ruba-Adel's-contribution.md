Technical document of methodology for develop a Digital Stethoscope AI 

* Motivation 
Building a digital stethoscope under $1.
Using AI for pulse rate for wide and easy adoption and use,
such as for diagnosing respiratory symptoms, and empowering doctors via telemedicine.


* Tools needed for the project
  - Microphone, Plug-In
  - Stethoscope
  - Scissors, Free Fall

* Technologies needed for the project 
  - Android studio to develop the app.
  - Emulator of Android mobile or physical Android device.
  - Machine Learning model to train it for sounds of pulse rate. 
  - Datasets of different sound of pulse rate related with Diseases such as typhoid. to used with ML model train.

* what we need to do 
  - Building the Stethoscope and recording sound.
  - Train the ML Model with Dataset in python environment.
  - Design the UI/UX of the app.
  - Develop Android app that record the inputted sound of Microphone Plug-In and pass it through that trainer model
    and save the possible results to show them on the screen, or send it for the doctor for telemedicine.
  

!! NOTE : I will define each technology with details such as the ML model, within the week ... after research discovery
